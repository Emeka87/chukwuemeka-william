    <p class="para">HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web, allowing users to design and display web pages with text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements in a structured and organized way, using a set of tags and attributes that define the structure and appearance of the content; it is the backbone of the web and a fundamental skill for web developers and designers who need to create and maintain websites and web applications, as it provides a standardized and universal way to define the layout, content, and behavior of web pages across different platforms and devices, making it possible for anyone with an internet connection to access and view information on the web, regardless of their location or device, while ensuring that the content is accessible, semantically meaningful, and compatible with different browsers and devices. HTML is constantly evolving, with new versions and features being added regularly to meet the changing needs of web developers and users, and it remains an essential part of the web development stack, alongside CSS and JavaScript, as it provides the foundation for building dynamic and interactive web pages and applications that engage users and deliver valuable content and services.
